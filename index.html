<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>We do not collect or store any information about you or your use of the app. </p>

<p>There is no sign-up or log-in. No analytics. No advertisement. No paid options. No location info.</p>

<p>The puzzles are only stored on your device. This means that if you lose your phone or tablet, there is no way for us to recreate the puzzles you have started or completed. Apple or Google may back up this information for you, but the information is never sent to us.</p>

<p>When starting the app, the app sends an http request to Cloudinary to get URLs for the images used by the puzzles. When creating a new puzzle, one of these image URLs are used to get the picture of the puzzle. The alternative would be to bundle all the images with the app, which would make it very, very large. Cloudinary's privacy policy can be found on https://cloudinary.com/privacy. Information logged by Cloudinary is not used by us.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:takksemd@gmail.com">takksemd@gmail.com</a></p>
