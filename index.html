Privacy Policy


We do not collect or store any information about you or your use of the app. 


There is no sign-up. No analytics. No advertisement. No paid options. Please use the app to help yourself or your child learn a bit of basic mathematical literacy, this is the only payment we want.


The puzzles are only stored on your device. If you lose your phone or tablet, there is no way for us to recreate your data. Apple or Google may back up this information for you, but we never see it. Nor do we want to.


When starting the app, the app sends an http request to Cloudinary to get URLs for the images. When creating a new puzzle, one of these image URLs are used to get the picture of the puzzle. The alternative would be to bundle all the images with the app, which would make it very, very large. Cloudinary's privacy policy can be found on https://cloudinary.com/privacy . The information logged by Cloudinary is not used by us.


If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please email us at takksemd@gmail.com
